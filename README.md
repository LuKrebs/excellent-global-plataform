<p>This is a project for a Brazilian Client who wish a online plataform for their students.</p>

<p>I have used HTML/CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap to develop this project. By the end, students will have an username and a password and will be able to rewatch class that they lost, download material that was used in the class and send an email for their teacher to solve their doubts. </p>

<p>Fell free to use this template in your own school/project or to send me a message if you have any doubt.</p>

<p>If you want to see it working, you can find it <a href="https://codepen.io/LuKrebs/full/ybNPJo/">here</a>. I also have put an image below, so you can see what it looks like.</p>
